## Project Overview

Student Retention Model
=========================

**Predicting student if they are at-risk of dropping out of college**

What if we can recognize clues and patterns that precede college student dropouts using data science and machine learning?
Given the right set of data of a student population consisting of both college drop outs and graduates, can we leverage predictive analytics to forecast student withdrawal actions?
When we study historical data of both kinds of student populations: - those that have discontinued their post-secondary education; - and also, those that have graduated and completed a degree; we hope to identify related factors and challenges for at-risk students.   

Addressing proactively the challenges faced by these students is the key!
Having early identification allows for a timely intervention and implement support strategies so students can overcome academic challenges and succeed in their education journey.
